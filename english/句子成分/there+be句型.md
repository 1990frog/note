There be 句型是英语中常用句型， 意思是“有”，表示“人或事物的存在”或“某地有某物”。There在此结构中是引导词，已经没有副词“那里”的含义。
There be 句型的构成形式一般为“There is/are + 某物/人 +某地/时”，表示某地/时有某物/人。

# 用法
There be 后面的名词是句子的主语，属倒装结构。疑问句形式是将be或will/have/can/must等助动词、情态动词提至there之前，否定形式则直接在be或助动词、情态动词后加not，因此要表达“某个地方或某个时间存在什么事物或人”的时候常用“There be + 名词+ 地点（时间）这一句型。
There are some sharks.
这有鲨鱼。
Excuse me. Is there a repair shop near here for MP3?
打搅了，附近有MP3维修店吗？
There are lots of people who can actually help you.
在那里，有许多人实际上可以帮助你。

# 结构
1、There be 句型中的be 应和其后出现的补充
语在数上一致，即“就近原则”，如：
There is a lamp on the table.
There are some apples in the bowl.
There are five books,two pens and a ruler in the school bag.
There is a ruler,two pens and five books in the school bag.
2、如果补语是复数名词，却表示一笔金额或一个总数或表达一个单个概念时，则仍用单数be形式，如：
There is five hundred dollars to pay.
There is still another 20 miles to drive.
There is duck and green vegetables for supper.
3、There be 中的be 有时可以是lie,stand,used to be,seem to be,appear to be 等，如：
There lies a river to the south.
There lived an old man in the small house.
There stood a temple near the river.
There used to be a castle at the foot of the hill.
4、There is(was)+not +动词ing结构相当于It is(was) impossible to +动词原形，如：
There is not going home. =It is impossible to go home.
There is not living with him.=It is impossible to live with him. 。
There is not knowing what may happen. =It is impossible to know what may happen

# 语法
主谓要一致
1.当动词be后所接的名词是单数可数名词或不可数名词时，be 应该取单数is；当其后所接的名词是复数的可数名词时，be用复数are。
There's a man at the door.门口有个人。
There is some apple juice in the bottle.瓶子里有些苹果汁。
There are some strangers in the street.大街上有一些陌生人。
2.如果There be 后面是几个并列名词做补语时，动词be的形式和最靠近它的那个名词保持数的一致。
There is an ashtray and two bottles on the shelf. 架子上有一只烟灰缸和两个瓶子。
There are two bottles and an ashtray on the shelf. 架子上有两个瓶子和一个烟灰缸。

1.There be 句型中动词be可以有一般现在时、一般过去时、将来时和完成时。

2.There be 句型可以和各种助动词、情态动词连用。
There may be a cigarette in that box.那只盒子里或许有支香烟。
There must be some cakes on the table.桌子上一定有些蛋糕。
There used to be a hospital there before the war.战前，那里曾经有家医院。
3.There be 句型也可以和这样一些的谓语动词连用：be going to 、seem to 、appear to 、used to、be likely to 、happen to ….

否定句
1.There be 句型的否定句构成方式是将否定副词not放在be 之后，如：

There aren’t any pens on the desk.课桌上没有钢笔。

和have的比较
1.区别点：there be 意为存在，强调某地有某物，不表示所属关系；have 表示所有关系， 强调某人或某地有某物，这是其基本用法。如：
There are some trees in front of the house.房前有些树。
Tom has many friends in China.汤姆在中国有许多朋友。
2.相同点：在表示结构上的含有时，既可以用there be 句型，也可以用have（has） 来表示。如：
There are many long rivers in China./China has many long rivers.中国有许多长河。
How many days are there in March?/How many days does March have?三月份有多少天？
非谓语动词形式：
There be 结构的非谓语动词形式是there to be 和there being 两种形式。在句中作主语、宾语和状语。
1. there being 结构起名词的作用，直接位于句首作主语，通常用it 作形式主语，并且用for引导。
There being a bus stop near my house is a great advantage.我家旁边有个公共汽车站，很是方便。
It is impossible for there to be any more.不可能再有了。
2. there be 结构作宾语时，通常用there to be ，常作这样一些词的宾语：expect，like, mean, intend, want,prefer,hate等。
I expect there to be no argument about this.我期望关于这件事不要再争吵了。
I should prefer there to be no discussion of my private affairs.我宁愿不要讨论我的私事。
People don’t want there to be another war.人们不希望再有战争了。
另外，作介词宾语时，如果是介词for，只能用“there to be”其它介词用“there being”
The teacher was waiting for there to be complete silence.老师在等着大家都安静下来。
I never dreamed of there being any good chance for me.我做梦也没想到我会有好机会。
3. 作状语的there be 形式，通常用“there being”结构。
There being nothing else to do ,we went home.因为没有其他事可做，我们就回家了。
They closed the door ,there being no customers.因为没有顾客，他们的店关门了。
一、构成：There be ...句型表示的是 “某处有(存在)某人或某物”，其结构为There be(is，are，was, were )+名词+地点状语。例如：
There are fifty-two students in our class.
There is a pencil in my pencil-case.
There was an old house by the river five years ago.
二、各种句式：
否定句：There be句型否定句式的构成和含有be动词的其它句型一样，在be后加上“not”。（名词）= not a\an\any + n.（名词）。注意： not a\an + n.（可数名词单数）； not any + n.（可数名词复数）；not any + n.（不可数名词）。例如：
There is an orange in her bag.
→There isn’t an orange in her bag.
There are some oranges in her bag.
→There aren’t any oranges in her bag.
There is some juice in the bottle.
→There isn’t any juice in the bottle.
一般疑问句：There be结构的一般疑问句变化只需把be动词移到句首，再在句尾加上问号即可。例如：
There is some money in her handbag.
→ Is there any money in her handbag? (疑问句和否定句中，some改为any, something改为anything.)
There is something new in today’s newspaper.
→There isn’t anything new in today’s newspaper.
→Is there anything new in today’s newspaper?
特殊疑问句：
There be句型的特殊疑问句有以下三种形式：
① 对主语提问：当主语是人时，用 “Who’s + 介词短语?”；当主语是物时，用 “What’s + 介词短语?”。其中there在口语中常常省略。注意：无论原句的主语是单数还是复数，对其提问时一般都用be的单数形式(回答时却要根据实际情况来决定)。如：
There is a bird in the tree. →What’s in the tree?
There are some bikes over there. →What’s over there?
There is a little girl in the room. →Who is in the room?
② 对地点状语提问：用 “Where is \ are + 主语?”表示（注意其答语变化）：例如：
There is a computer in my office.
→ Where is the computer? ----It’s in my office.
There are four children in the classroom.
→Where are the four children?—They’ re in the classroom.
③ 对数量提问：一般有两种提问方式：
如果主语是可数名词，无论是单数还是复数，都用“How many +可数名词复数+ are there + 介词短语？”表示：
There are twelve months in a year.
→How many months are there in a year?
There is only one book in my bag.
→ How many books are there in your bag?
There is a cat in the box.
→ How many cats are there in the box?
如果主语是不可数名词，则用“ How much + 不可数名词 + is there + 介词短语？”表示：
There is some money in my purse. How much money is there in
your purse?
反意疑问句：There be或There加其它动词，其反意疑问句一律用…there?例如：
There is a beautiful girl in the garden, isn’t there?
There used to be no school here, used there \did there?
三、注意事项：
1. There be句型中be动词的形式要和其后的主语在人称和数上保持一致。
如果句子的主语是单数的可数名词，或是不可数名词，be动词用“is”“was”。例如：
There is a basketball in the box.
There is a little milk in the glass.
如果句子的主语是复数名词，be动词就用“are” “were”。例如：
There are many birds in the tree.　There were many people in the street yesterday.
如果有两个或两个以上的名词作主语，be动词要和最靠近它的那个主语在数上保持一致，也就是我们常说的 “就近原则”。例如：
There is an orange and some bananas in the basket.
There are some bananas and an orange in the basket.
2. There与be中间可插入一些表推测的情态动词、表时态的短语和一些动词短语 (如和将来时be going to\ will、现在完成时 have\has + pp、used to结构等连用，注意其构成形式,这一内容在我们日常练习中经常出现错误,是一难点,也是历年中考试题中的一个考点.)。例如：
There must be a pen in the box.
There happened to be some money in my pocket.
There is going to be a meeting tonight.
There has been a big tree on the top of the hill.
There used to be a church across from the bank.
3. There be句型和have\has的区别：
There be句型表示 “存在有”, have\has表示 “拥有” “所有”,两者不能同时使用.例如：
桌子上有三本书. There are three books on the desk.
我有三本书. I have three books.
4. There be + 主语 + doing +介词短语. 例如：
There is a truck collecting rubish outside.
There is a wallet lying on the ground.
举例
There are two dogs in the garden.
There weren't any people in the park yesterday.
There won't be another football match next Sunday.
There have been some changes since you left last week. There is a book on the desk.
There can't be anything new.
Must there be an indefinite article here?
Is there going to be a post office in the village?
